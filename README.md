<br />
My submissions for the Advent of Code challenges for 2024.<br />
All submissions have been accepted as correct.<br />
I have sectioned each daily challenge into its own folder.<br />

Included in each folder are:<br />
- a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) with parts 1 and 2 in different <br />
  cells, used for testing and calculating the result<br />
- a python file (.py) for part 1 of the question<br />
- a python file (.py) for part 2 of the question<br />
- a text file (.txt) containing the sample input supplied by the website<br />
  to analyze and use in deriving the challenge's solution<br />
* NOTE: Actual input is not shared at the request of the site.<br />
  you can obtain your own input by registering an account on AoC.<br />

Please do not cheat and plagiarize my solutions when completing the <br />
challenges on your own. <br />
